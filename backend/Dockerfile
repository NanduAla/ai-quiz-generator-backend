# backend/Dockerfile

# 1. Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# 2. Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy the requirements file and install dependencies
# We install dependencies first to leverage Docker's build cache
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 4. Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# 5. Expose the port the application will run on (FastAPI default is 8000)
EXPOSE 8000

# 6. Define the command to run the application using Uvicorn
# --host 0.0.0.0 makes the app accessible from outside the container
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
